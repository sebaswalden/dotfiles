# Neovim Configuration

Personal Neovim configuration using Lazy as plugin manager.

Based on [ThePrimeagen's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE), he's just great!

## Requirements

- A Nerd Font (for icons)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (required for Telescope)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (optional, faster file finding)

## Installation

On first launch, run `:Lazy` to install plugins. This should be done automatically on ../setup.sh, but if for some reason I wanted to do this manually, now I remember how it was done.
